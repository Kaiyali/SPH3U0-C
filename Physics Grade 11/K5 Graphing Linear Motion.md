#### Part A: 
* Linear means striaght lines
* Motion means movement

There are only 2 peieces of information on these graphs... positive (y value) and time (x time). 

* Using this graph we can easily ditermine the displacement (chagne in position) of the object.
	* <font color="#6C0BA9">If </font>the position is increasing the displacement is positive → Forward
	* <font color="#6C0BA9">If </font>the position is decreasing the displacemetn is negatice → backward
	* <font color="#6C0BA9">If </font>the position is not chanigng there is no displacement

* Velocity is teh cahgne in position (displacement) over a change in time... Since we have position and time measurment on this graph are shown, we can use it to calcaulate the velocity.
* Slope: The Slope of this graph is the [[K2 Velocity|velocity]] 

* A postive slope is a forward velocity. A negative slope is a backward velocity. Calcaulate the slope to get the speed of the object. 
* All these straight lines, have a sonstant slope/velocities... Therefore, there is no acceleration on this graph.

#### Part B:

Accleration is the change in velocity and velocity is the slope of a position-time graph. Then acceleration must cause the slope to change.

A note on "instancous velocity" vs "average velocity"

* To ge the Average Velocity of a mocing object two points of information must be given
* its inital position and time as well as its final position and time

#### Part C:

For *only one point* of information you must use "instanceous velocity"

A Tagent line is a straight line that only touches a graph at one point, It does not go through the graph it merely bruushes b
