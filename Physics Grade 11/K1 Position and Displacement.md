*Position:* Tells us where something is. A position is a point that is not mvoing (relative to something else).
|Distance | Displacement|
|---------|------------|
|Distance is how far have you travelled| Displacement is how far away you are from the start|
|Distance does not care where you go, direction does not matter| Displacement has a direction, pointing from start to end|
|Distance is a scaler| Displacement is a vector |

## Positioning Logic

- Jimmy is 10m South of Abdul
	- Mathematical formula: d$_J$ = 10m {South of Abdul}
* The distance = d$_J$ → 10m + 20m + 10m = 40m
	* Therefore the `distance` is going to be 40m.
* The displacement = (vector) d$_J$ → 20m{E}
	* Therefore the `displacement`  is going to be 20m.
