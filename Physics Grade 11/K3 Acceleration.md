*Acceleration* is how quickly an object's velocity changes over time.

Acceleration is cordinated with how velocity works. If a velocity of an object maintains in a constaint rate there would be no acceleration. On the other hand, when an object changes its velocity there would be a some level of acceleration.

Although in physics negatives are frowned upon in acceleration there are negative values. If the acceleration is in the same direction as the [[K2 Velocity|velocity]] the value would be positive; but if the [[K2 Velocity|velocity]] is in the opposite  direction the acceleration value would be negative.

*  If the answer is in a negative value it means that the object is losing speed
